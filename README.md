# school_project
makes connection between Python front end and SQL backend database
this project also has a nice front-end menu to interact with database easily.
python functions definitions are used very frequently in this.
this project gave me a lot clairity about functions and functions in functions and i
f-else statement inside functions.
#to define a function
we type:
def functionname():
      fucntion defined
      with and 
      indent all the things inside this indent is inside the function.
to call the funvtion jist type:
functionname()
in python shell or in .py file
menu() function
the core of front end in this project the function was first defined and the used at the last
after defining the remaining functions.
